In the script when we listing commits occured 3 weeks ago we use

git log --since="3 weeks ago" --pretty=format:"%H %an %cd" --date=short | while read -r commit_hash author commit_date; do ...

It cannot captures author name correctly because output of the 

"git log --since="3 weeks ago" --pretty=format:"%H %an %cd" --date=short"

command is like;

cb4287940ecb22e2af736eef8ef604fbe23d68cc Mehmet TOSUN 2024-12-24

can you fix this part so that author name and date field captures correctly


In the code where we add  commit files to the commit;

commit_json="{\"hash\": \"$commit_hash\", \"author\": \"$author\", \"email\": \"$email\", \"commit_date\": \"$commit_date\", \"files\": $files_json}"

It does not append files_json properly and the constructed commit_json can we fix that

when we pipe commant output like;

git log --since="3 weeks ago" --pretty=format:"%H%x09%an%x09%ae%x09%cd" --date=short 

to a while loop it creates a subshell. Whet while loop ends we lost all the changes in variables like files_json. So we cannot construct json fields correctly. How can we fix that 


there is a problem when we determine whether the same author last changed the file or not. can we use git blame command for this

can you also fix inner while loop which is also use

git show --pretty="" --name-only "$commit_hash"

command and pipes it to "while" command. It also creates a subshell which couse wrong output


git blame should check the author which make the changes before specific commit. We are looping over commits and it should check the author before the commit. So this command

last_author=$(git blame --line-porcelain "$file" | grep "^author " | head -n 1 | cut -d' ' -f2-)

should be fixed I think
